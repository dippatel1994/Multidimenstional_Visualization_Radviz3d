# Multidimenstional Visualization Using Radviz3d

## Goal

Convert high dimensional data into 3-dimensional points and plot attributes on the sphere and plot the points inside the sphere and than visualize 12 datasets from UCI machine learning repository


## Datasets

We have visualized 12 datasets from [UCI Machine Learning](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) website. Following datasets were visualized from the site.

1. [Iris dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
2. [Adult dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)
3. [Wine dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine)
4. [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
5. [Heart Disease dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
6. [Wine Quality dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)
7. [Bank Marketing dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
8. [Car Evaluation dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation)
9. [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
10. [Abalone dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)
11. [Forest Fires dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires)
12. [Student Performance dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)


## Tools Used
<Strong>Language: </Strong> R
<br>
<Strong>Libraries: </Strong>  [radviz3d](https://github.com/fanne-stat/radviz3d/)

## How to run the code?

First install R language and R studio software from the interent for your operating system. After installing the software open r studion and run following code in it.

** Please keep the csv files in same folder or change its relative path in order to run the code succesfully. Those are processed files

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("fanne-stat/radviz3d")
```
