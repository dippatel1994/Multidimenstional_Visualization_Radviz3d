This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
wine <- read.csv(url("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data"),  header = TRUE)
names(wine) <- c("Alcohol", "Malic acid", "Ash", "Alcalinity of ash", "Magnesium", "Total phenols", "Flavanoids", "Nonflavanoid phenols", "Proanthocyanins", "Color intensity", "Hue", "OD280/OD315 of diluted wines", "Proline", "Last")

radialvis3d(data = wine[, 2:14], cl = factor(wine$Alcohol), domrp = F, npc = 3,doGtrans = F, 
            lwd = 0, alpha = 0.40, pradius = 0.025, class.labels = unique(wine$Alcohol),
            coord.cex=0.8)
```


```{r}
library(help = "datasets")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
